🟦 Image Downloader
━━━━━━━━━━
To save multiple photos at once, this extension enables you to:
- Browse pictures on the active webpage
- Filter by size, dimensions, or URL
- Download or view any single photo with one click
- Save to a subfolder
- Rename downloaded files
- Download in the background!

Note: If no default download folder is set, you’ll need to choose a save location for each photo, which may trigger multiple popups. Configure a download directory in your browser settings for a smoother experience.

❓ FAQs
━━━━
💭 Why does this extension need access to all site data?
To extract photos from a webpage, Image Downloader must access all content when the popup is activated. No data is sent off your device. See our Privacy Policy for details: https://pactinteractive.github.io/image-downloader

💭 Why were some downloaded photos smaller or missing?
Image Downloader only retrieves photos currently displayed on the page, which may be thumbnails rather than full-resolution versions (e.g., in Facebook albums). Some sites, like Instagram, load only a few pictures at a time in carousels to save bandwidth.

We’re exploring ways to improve Image Downloader’s capabilities. For now, consider using extensions tailored to specific sites (e.g., Facebook) for advanced functionality.
